              <p>JavaScript is NOT Java! Instead, a good definition of JavaScript or JS is: "JavaScript allows you to make web pages more interactive by assessing and modifying
                the content and markup used in a web page while it is being viewed in the browser." JavaScript works with different object types, including strings, numbers, dates, and arrays.
                Object types can be used to store different types of data, and they can also be used to perform different actions. 
                It also works with different items such as: methods, functions, objects, and regular expressions. It includes if statements, switch statements, loops, and functions.
                A method is an action that can be performed on objects. A function is a block of code that can be called and executed when needed. An object is a collection of properties and methods.
                It includes if statements, switch statements, loops, and functions. Loops are used to run the same block of code over and over again, as long as a certain condition is true.
                A switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. A function is a block of code that can be called and executed when needed.
