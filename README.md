# Bootcamp Final Project -sockCamp
 A pre-BootCamp learning experience  ...because you have to put on your sock before you put on your boot!

# Description
![sockCamp Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/sockCamp-green)

The idea behind sockCamp was to create an application that lets the user get a real look at what Bootcamp is all about.  We have started out by offering 4 different topics to explore. Each topic comes with a paragraph or two explaining what that subject is about and how to use it.  We have also included questions on each topic for the user to test what they have learned. By participating in sockCamp, the user gets the opportunity to experience what kind of information is taught.  Users spend time working to get a ture, behind the sceens look at Bootcamp. The more the user is prepared and ready, the more that person will learn and get out of the actual Bootcamp experience.

## User Story

BEFORE signing up for Bootcamp
I want to get an inside look at what it is all about
SO I know if this is something for me to pursue, and if I will like writing code.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a home page, I have the choice to login or sign up
WHEN I get to the welcome page I am given a description of what sockCamp is about and the topics that I can learn
THEN I can click on the topic of my choice.

WHEN I choose a topic
THEN I am sent to that page
WHERE I will find information on the topic, and what I need to know about it

WHEN I have read about the topic
THEN I have the option to answer questions on that topic to test my knowledge

WHEN I have gone through the topics I will also have the choice of a 5th topic, the Combo
WHEN clicking on the "Combo" button
THEN I will be taken to a page that offers a quiz combining random questions from all four of the previous topics.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This application uses the following dependencies:

## Usage

## Installation

A user must so an npm i  and then an npm run dev to start the application.

## Future deployment: 

What we would like to see in the future is an expanded version of this application.  More topics, more detail, more and diverse questions.
